# Network
* [LWAN](https://github.com/lpereira/lwan)<br>
Lwan is a high-performance & scalable web server.
It's suitable to be used from embedded devices to robust servers. Both static and dynamic content can be served, as it can also be used as a library. Dynamic content can be generated by code written in either C or Lua.
* [NNG](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng)<br>
NNG, like its predecessors nanomsg (and to some extent ZeroMQ), is a lightweight, broker-less library, offering a simple API to solve common recurring messaging problems, such as publish/subscribe, RPC-style request/reply, or service discovery. The API frees the programmer from worrying about details like connection management, retries, and other common considerations, so that they can focus on the application instead of the plumbing.
NNG is implemented in C, requiring only C99 and CMake to build. It can be built as a shared or a static library, and is readily embeddable. It is also designed to be easy to port to new platforms if your platform is not already supported.
